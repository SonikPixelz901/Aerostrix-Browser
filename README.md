## Overview

**Aerostrix Browser** is simple browser made mostly in Rust. You can use it, or get the code and modify it to whatever you like. This is more of a project for me to learn Rust rather than make the next-gen browser. For now.

> ⚠️ This project is intended for me to learn Rust. It is (for now) not serious and may come with serious flaws or security issues.

## Features

- 🛡️ **Private**  
  It is made only by one person, so it is really private. Aerostrix Browser promises safety and privacy at all times.

- ⚡ **Fast**  
  Aerostrix Browser is very fast and optimized for performance. It is independent and not based on other big browsers.

- 🌿 **Frutiger Aero**  
  The browser features a beautiful once super popular style called Frutiger Aero.
